Jexler is a simple relaxed Groovy framework for starting/stopping
Groovy scripts as services and enabling them to react to events
of their choice - great for prototyping and useful for automating.

Comes as a core library (JAR) plus a web GUI (WAR).

* Web GUI: Groovy, Servlet 2.5
* Unit tests written with https://code.google.com/p/spock/[Spock]

== Build

* Quick build: `gradle clean build`
* Full build: `gradle clean build pom jacoco`

== Try web GUI

* Demo: `gradle demo`
* Go to http://localhost:9080/
* or deploy jexler/build/libs/jexler-*.war

== Docker

You can build a Docker image and run it with the following commands:

```
gradle clean explodedWar
docker build -t jexler .
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 jexler
```
